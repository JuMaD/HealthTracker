Next steps (no particular order):
- add import csv to UI (including joining both dfs, mapping columns to the value the program tracks etc.)
- add multi-language support for column names etc.
- make Grenzwerte independent of the locally stored results and add citations as well as comments for to each individual Grenzwert
- allow users to pick Grenzwerte from the seperate file (giving them multiple options including the source of the values)
- package into windows and mac programs?
- improve display of time series (right now its a bit skewed since the aspect ratios dont match)
- add dummy data so the Readme can contain some visual excamples
